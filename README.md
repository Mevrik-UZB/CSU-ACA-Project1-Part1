Suggested working steps:
1) Get Halt & noop Instruction working in your simulation. Provide the commands to compile and run the
test case for halt and noop. 5 Points.
2) Implement Add & Nand & Mult (assuming NO hazards.) Provide instructions to compile and run test cases
for add, nand, and mult. 3 Points.
3) Implement LW and SW (assuming no hazards.) Provide instructions to compile and run test cases. 3 Points.
4) Implement BEQ assuming no hazards (just put in no ops.) Provide instructions to compile and run test
cases. 3 Points.
Here are the key points to implement and test the requested MIPS instructions in a simulator:
1. Halt and NOOP instructions:
Implement HALT by adding a check in the main simulation loop to exit when the opcode for HALT is
encountered.
Implement NOOP as an instruction that does nothing (advances PC but performs no other operations).
To compile and run:
python mips
_
simulator
_
halt
_
noop_
test.py
This implementation defines the HALT and NOOP opcodes, creates simulated memory and registers, and
implements the basic functionality for these two instructions. The simulate function processes a list of
instructions, and the test
_
halt
_
noop function creates a test case with one NOOP instruction followed by a
HALT instruction.
2. ADD, NAND, MULT instructions:
Implement ADD by adding the values in two source registers and storing in destination register.
Implement NAND by performing bitwise NAND on two source registers.
Implement MULT by multiplying two source registers and storing result in HI/LO registers.
To compile and run:
python mips
_
simulator
_
arithmetic
_
test.py
This implementation defines the ADD, NAND, and MULT opcodes, creates simulated memory and
registers, and implements the basic functionality for these three instructions. The simulate function
processes a list of instructions, and the test
_
arithmetic function creates a test case with one instruction for
each operation.
Note that this implementation assumes no hazards, as specified in the requirements. In a real
processor, you would need to handle hazards and implement the full pipeline stages.
3. LW and SW instructions:
Implement LW by loading a word from memory into a register.
Implement SW by storing a word from a register into memory.
To compile and run:
python mips
_
simulator
_
memory_
test.py
This implementation defines the LW and SW opcodes, creates simulated memory and registers, and
implements the basic functionality for these two instructions. The simulate function processes a list of
instructions, and the test
_
lw
_
sw function creates a test case that demonstrates loading from memory, storing
to memory, and then loading the stored values back into different registers.
Note that this implementation assumes no hazards, as specified in the requirements. In a real processor, you
would need to handle hazards and implement the full pipeline stages.
4. BEQ instruction:
Implement BEQ by comparing two registers and branching if equal.
Insert NOOPs after branch to handle branch delay slot.
To compile and run:
python mips
_
simulator
_
branch
_
test.py
This implementation includes:
1. BEQ instruction that compares two registers and branches if they are equal.
2. ADD, NAND, and MULT instructions as requested.
3. A simple program counter (PC) to keep track of instruction execution.
4. Insertion of a NOP after each branch instruction (simulating no hazard handling).
5. A test case that demonstrates the use of all implemented instructions.
The output will show the execution of each instruction, including whether branches are taken or not, and the
final state of the registers.
For the full implementation, we would need to:
1. Define opcodes and function codes for each instruction
2. Add parsing logic in the simulator to decode each instruction type
3. Implement the execution logic for each instruction
4. Create test assembly files to verify correct behavior
5. Add appropriate error checking and edge case handling
The exact code would depend on our simulator's existing structure, but these are the key components to add
support for the requested instructions.
This script implements a simplified MIPS simulator with the requested instructions. It includes test cases for
each instruction type. The simulate function processes a list of instructions, decoding and executing each
one.
Note that this is a basic implementation and doesn't include all the complexities of a real MIPS processor
(like pipeline stages, hazard detection, etc.). It's meant to demonstrate the basic functionality of the
requested instructions.
